# Proof of Concepts
As the result of plugin writing or just general bug hunting, researchers at Tenable often stumble upon new and interesting vulnerabilities. These vulnerabililities are shared with the community on our [company blog](https://www.tenable.com/blog), [Medium](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog), or through our [research advisories](https://www.tenable.com/security/research). We've decided to create a more centralized repository for our proof of concepts. Everything is sorted by vendor with subdirectories for each product.
